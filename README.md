# sveltekit-starter

Everything you need to build an awesome Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Install dependencies

```bash
# recommended
# npm install -g @antfu/ni
# (https://github.com/antfu-collective/ni)

npm install # with @antfu/ni, just run `ni`
```

## Developing

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev # nr dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
